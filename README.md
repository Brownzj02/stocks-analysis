Analyzing 2017 and 2018 Green Stock Performance---
## Overview
The purpose of DAQO/ Stock Analysis was to assist Steve was advising his parents in diversifying their portfolio. They invested all their funds into DAQO, but Steve is trying to determine what some of their best options would be along with DAQO.---
## Results
I cannot advise on the results of refactoring, as I had some error with my code. The assuption is however it should be faster and more efficient in its data output for the end user. Using VBA alone to determine if initial code was correct, it took a little over one second to execute a run time for 2018. I believe there has to be an error in one my loops to not be able to run 2017 analysis. I was able to return a pop up that allowed me to insert a date and attempt to pull information though through the button function.---
## Summary
1. Some of the advantages to refactoring include finding bugs, making software easier to understand, improves layout, and can make processes faster.
2. Similar to the issue I ran into, a major disadvantage can inlude not understanding the initial code and what I'm trying to improve. An advatage though I think is improved functionally for the end user. If the purpose was to assist Steve by working on the developer's end, a refactored script can mean the ability to pull data faster and deal with less bugs when attempting to extract data.
3. In conclusion, speaking from how I utilized refactoring, the cons are that I still got a little lost in the code. In the initial VBA file, I was able to follow along and execute most of the tasks in the module. However, for someone that is novice to this, it can become easy to get lost in some the data and understanding how it should be performing.
